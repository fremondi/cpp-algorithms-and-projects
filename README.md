# C++ Algorithms and Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of C++ projects developed as part of the Coursera specialization  
**“Go and C++: Programming in Two Successor Languages of C”** by the University of California, Santa Cruz,  
taught by **Prof. Ira Pohl**.

The projects are organised into **Part A** and **Part B**, reflecting a progression from core C++ concepts
and algorithms to more advanced object-oriented design, STL usage, and game-based AI techniques.

## Part A – Core C++ and Algorithms  
**C++ For C Programmers, Part A**

This section focuses on transitioning from C to modern C++, emphasising type safety, object-oriented
programming, and fundamental graph algorithms.

**Key topics covered:**
- Converting C programs to C++ and avoiding the preprocessor
- Type-safe input/output
- Functions, templates, and generics
- Classes, constructors, copy semantics, and dynamic memory management
- Graph representations and traversal
- Shortest path and minimum spanning tree algorithms

**Representative implementations include:**
- Adjacency matrix graph representation
- Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
- Prim’s and Kruskal’s minimum spanning tree algorithms
- Linked lists and cumulative sum utilities

## Part B – STL, Object-Oriented Design, and Game AI  
**C++ For C Programmers, Part B**

This section builds on Part A by introducing advanced C++ features, the Standard Template Library (STL),
inheritance, and AI techniques through the game of Hex.

**Key topics covered:**
- STL architecture, containers, iterators, and generic algorithms
- Lambda expressions and function objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Graph-based game representations
- Game AI techniques (Min-Max, Alpha-Beta pruning)
- Monte Carlo methods for move evaluation
- C++11 move semantics, assertions, exceptions, and design patterns

**Representative implementations include:**
- Hex board representation and gameplay logic
- Object-oriented card and poker-related classes
- Algorithmic problem-solving exercises (e.g. palindrome checking)

## Notes
- Each project is self-contained and focuses on clarity, correctness, and conceptual understanding.
- Compiled binaries and build artifacts are excluded via `.gitignore`.
- The repository is intended as a learning and portfolio showcase rather than production-ready software.
